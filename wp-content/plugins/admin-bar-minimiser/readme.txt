Now there is an easy way to minimise the new WordPress 3.1 admin bar at the click of a button! 

== Description ==

Note: This Plugin works only with WordPress 3.1 and higher.

Successfully tested on a WordPress Multisite install without any issues. Thanks to <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/users/kpdesign/" target="_blank">Kim Parsell</a> for Multisite testing.

So what does this Plugin do? Well, if you have used a beta version of WordPress 3.1 you will know that on the front end of your blog pages you now have displayed, by default, an admin bar. This gives you a menu full of quick links to your WordPress admin panel. A lot of users don't seem to like the admin panel displayed at the top of every page, and so seek ways to disable it or remove it.

You can easily disable it on a per user basis via a users profile page, but this is not that useful if you want to remove it site-wide. The Admin Bar Minimiser Plugin was written to help users keep the admin bar active but be able to minimise it at any time to make it less obtrusive. 

You can see a video demo of the Plugin here:

The Plugin works by allowing you to minimise the admin bar from view via a single click! And you can bring it back just as easily. This also works for the admin bar displayed on the WordPress back end too. :)

There is also an options page included with the Plugin. You have options whether to set the admin bar maximised or minimised by default on the front end, and back end.

Please rate this Plugin if you find it useful, thanks.
